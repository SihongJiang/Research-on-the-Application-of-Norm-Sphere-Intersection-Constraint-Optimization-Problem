# Research-on-the-Application-of-Norm-Sphere-Intersection-Constraint-Optimization-Problem
This project comes from my undergraduate graduation thesis. 
The main part of my thesis is applying a new algorithm to a existing type of optimization problem 
and discuss the differences between the old and new algorithm in their performance.
